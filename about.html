                    <h1>Hello, thank you for visiting my website.</h1>
                    <p>My name is Daniel Zhang and I am a U1 student currently studying at McGill University. I am majoring in Computer Science and I hope to obtain a minor in 
                        Finance. I am the VP External of FUSS (First Year Undergraduate Science Society). In other words, I am the FUSS representative, I collaborate with other clubs
                        to organize events and I look for sponsorships.</p>
                    <p>I was also part of the Canadian fencing team in 2016. I've won multiple provincial competitions and awards; I was team captain for an European Circuit; I was 
                        coach of the region Lac-St-Louis during the Jeux du Quebec.</p>
                    <p>As a programmer, I do not have a lot of experience since this is my first year learning how to program. However, I was able to code the arcade game "Space
                        Invaders" using PyGame and an AI bot that can play the rummy game (this was a school project). I am currently enrolled in a machine learning class given by 
                        Andrew Ng on Coursera. The only computer science language I know well is Python. However, I am presently learning Java, C, Octave, HTML, CSS and how to use 
                        MathLab. On another note, I am also trilingual.</p>
